  description: |
    This API defines the mapping between an instance of an ASA CycleControl interface and the OCF OperationalState Resource.
    The ASA interface also supports a Method, ExecuteOperationalCommand; this is handled in OCF using an instance of oic.r.actuator within an oic.r.action collection.
    Please see Section 8 of the Mapping Specification for specifics.
